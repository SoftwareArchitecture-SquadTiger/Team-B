# Explanation for Each Top Directory in `src`

1. **assets/**  
   - Purpose: Stores static files such as images, fonts, or other resources that are used globally in the application.
   - Examples: Logos, icons, and other reusable design assets.

2. **components/**  
   - Purpose: Contains shared React components that are not tied to any specific feature or module. These are reusable UI components like buttons, modals, or headers used across the app.
   - Examples: `Button`, `Card`, `Navbar`.

3. **hooks/**  
   - Purpose: Stores shared custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic across different parts of the application.
   - Examples: Hooks for fetching data, handling form inputs, or managing authentication state.

4. **modules/**  
   - Purpose: Organizes the application into feature-specific modules, making the codebase modular and scalable. Each module focuses on a specific functionality or feature and contains its own components, pages, hooks, and services.
   - Subfolders:  
     - **components/**: Feature-specific reusable components.  
     - **pages/**: Pages/screens for the feature.  
     - **hooks/**: Custom hooks specific to the feature.  
     - **services/**: API calls or business logic related to the feature.

5. **services/**  
   - Purpose: Contains shared service files for API calls, utility functions, or any application-wide business logic.
   - Examples: HTTP client setup, error handling utilities.

6. **state/**  
   - Purpose: Manages the application's global state using tools like Redux, Context API, or Zustand.
   - Examples: State for authentication, user preferences, or application themes.

7. **App.jsx**  
   - Purpose: The main application component that acts as the root of the React app. It sets up routing and wraps the application with global providers (e.g., state, theme, or context).

8. **main.jsx**  
   - Purpose: The entry point of the React application, where the React app is rendered into the DOM. It usually includes ReactDOM or other rendering libraries.
